# Hotel-Booking-Demand

## Abstract
This data article describes two datasets with hotel demand data. One of the hotels (H1) is a resort hotel and the other is a city hotel (H2). Both datasets share the same structure, with 31 variables describing the 40,060 observations of H1 and 79,330 observations of H2. Each observation represents a hotel booking. Both datasets comprehend bookings due to arrive between the 1st of July of 2015 and the 31st of August 2017, including bookings that effectively arrived and bookings that were canceled. Since this is hotel real data, all data elements pertaining hotel or costumer identification were deleted. Due to the scarcity of real business data for scientific and educational purposes, these datasets can have an important role for research and education in revenue management, machine learning, or data mining, as well as in other fields.

## Value of the data

    • Descriptive analytics can be employed to further understand patterns, trends, and anomalies in data;
    • Used to perform research in different problems like: bookings cancellation prediction, customer segmentation, customer satiation, seasonality, among others;
    • Researchers can use the datasets to benchmark bookings’ prediction cancellation models against results already known;
    • Machine learning researchers can use the datasets for benchmarking the performance of different algorithms for solving the same type of problem (classification, segmentation, or other);
    • Educators can use the datasets for machine learning classification or segmentation problems;
    • Educators can use the datasets to obtain either statistics or data mining training.

## Data
In tourism and travel related industries, most of the research on Revenue Management demand forecasting and prediction problems employ data from the aviation industry, in the format known as the Passenger Name Record (PNR). This is a format developed by the aviation industry. However, the remaining tourism and travel industries like hospitality, cruising, theme parks, etc., have different requirements and particularities that cannot be fully explored without industry׳s specific data. Hence, two hotel datasets with demand data are shared to help in overcoming this limitation.
The datasets now made available were collected aiming at the development of prediction models to classify a hotel booking׳s likelihood to be canceled. Nevertheless, due to the characteristics of the variables included in these datasets, their use goes beyond this cancellation prediction problem.

## Project Objectives

The main objective of this hotel data analysis is to provide a comprehensive and in-depth view of the operations and financial performance of two hotels through three specific dashboards. The goal is to identify key patterns, optimize strategic decision-making, and improve business operational efficiency. The specific objectives are as follows:

 · Analyze seasonality and hotel occupancy rates, identifying peaks and valleys in demand, as well as fluctuations related to high seasons, local events, and weekdays.
 · Evaluate hotel profitability using metrics such as ADR (Average Daily Rate) and RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room), providing a clear analysis of revenue generated per occupied room and per available room.
 · Monitor booking and cancellation behavior, identifying patterns based on customer type, booking channel, and season, to optimize inventory management and minimize associated losses.
 · Segment and analyze customers based on their profile and preferences, detecting the most demanded room characteristics, average stay duration, and repeat rate to improve the offering and customer experience.
 · Assess the operational efficiency of hotels, identifying areas for improvement in resource utilization, capacity management, and response capacity to demand variations.
 · Analyze price elasticity and the impact of discounts and promotions on bookings, optimizing pricing strategies to maximize revenue without sacrificing occupancy.
 · Provide a comparative analysis of revenue and losses, including identifying net revenue sources and the relationship between effective and total revenue.
 · Monitor key hotel KPIs over time to evaluate hotel performance and competitiveness in the market.

The purpose of this analysis is to provide a clear and accessible visual tool that enables hotel managers to make informed decisions to improve operational efficiency, increase revenue, and minimize losses, thereby maximizing the profitability of both hotels.

## Project Description

This hotel data analysis project focuses on evaluating and optimizing the performance of two hotels (Resort Hotel and City Hotel) using Tableau visualization tools. The analysis was conducted through three main dashboards, designed to provide a clear and detailed view of the most relevant aspects of hotel operations.

 **• Bookings and Cancellations Dashboard:** Focused on analyzing booking behavior, cancellation rates, and no-show patterns. This section studies trends in reservations over time, allowing the identification of high and low-demand periods, as well as potential factors influencing booking cancellations.

 **• Revenue and Losses Dashboard:** This dashboard provides a detailed view of revenue generated, losses due to cancellations, and the relationship between applied rates (ADR) and room occupancy. It also helps identify the main sources of revenue and profitability variations according to different periods and customer segments.

 **• General Dashboard and KPIs:** Provides an overview of the hotel's key performance indicators, including occupancy rate, total revenue, cancellation rate, and ADR. The goal of this panel is to offer a global view of hotel performance in one place, facilitating the comparison of key KPIs over time.

Throughout this project, various analytical techniques have been used to break down the data into value segments and extract patterns that can guide decision-making. This includes seasonality analysis, customer segmentation, and an evaluation of each hotel's operational efficiency. The final result is a tool that enables hotel managers to better understand their operations and make data-driven decisions to improve profitability and customer satisfaction.

## Conclusions

The data analysis conducted on the operations of both hotels (Resort Hotel and City Hotel) has helped identify several key trends affecting both profitability and operational efficiency. Through the three implemented dashboards, the following key points were highlighted:

**• Seasonality and Demand:** Clear seasonality patterns are observed, directly impacting occupancy rates and overall booking demand. High and low occupancy months have been precisely identified, allowing for more effective demand forecasting. 
Leveraging this insight, hotels could implement dynamic pricing policies to adjust rates based on projected demand. During low occupancy periods, discounts or promotional packages could be offered to attract more customers, maximizing RevPar.

**• Cancellations and No-Shows:** The data reveals a significant cancellation rate, especially during certain times of the year, negatively affecting potential revenue. The analysis of cancellations and no-shows highlights the need to review cancellation policies and encourage early booking confirmations.
It is advisable to revise and strengthen cancellation policies or implement incentives to ensure customers keep their reservations, such as discounts for early payments or stricter penalties for last-minute cancellations.

**• Revenue and Profitability:** A detailed revenue analysis indicates that ADR (Average Daily Rate) has a significant influence on RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room). Fluctuations in rates over time were detected, suggesting optimization opportunities, especially during low occupancy periods.
During periods of low demand, resource management strategies can be implemented to optimize costs. Additionally, improving communication with customers to reduce no-shows could have a positive impact on occupancy and revenue.

**• Customer Segmentation:** The segmentation analysis revealed that certain customer groups generate higher profitability than others, opening the opportunity to adjust marketing and loyalty strategies to focus on these key segments.
Hotels should focus on retaining the most profitable customers, utilizing data to personalize offers, enhance customer experience, and increase loyalty, which will ultimately improve profitability in the long run.
Additionally, identified seasonality patterns could be used to launch targeted marketing campaigns aimed at increasing occupancy during low-demand months and maximizing revenue during peak demand periods.
These actions will help improve retention, boost profitability, and offer a more tailored experience aligned with customer needs, based on data and objective patterns.
